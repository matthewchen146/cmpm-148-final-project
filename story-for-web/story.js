It offers some relief, but the computer should have set the temperature to a more comfortable level before waking up the crew.","\n","^It suddenly occurs to you that the crew is not awake.  You alone have been roused from slumber.  The only reason the computer might wake up a lone engineer like this is because something on the ship is wrong, and the only reason you would be woken up instead of one of the lead engineers is because something is wrong with their HSUs.  You stifle a swear before accessing the diagnostic terminal nearby.  Sure enough, there are several error messages.  Abnormal readings in life support, alien research lab, and engine room.  A brief, intrusive thought flashes to the front of your mind; two of these are vital systems, plus a breach in the alien lab.  Could a specimen have..?  No, your friends always said you watched too many science fiction horror movies to work on a ship like this, you aren’t about to prove them right.  Still, what had happened to the head engineers?  It didn’t matter now, the nature of each of these systems demanded immediate attention.  The crew was counting on you to fix the ship so they could all reach their next destination.  Signing out of the terminal, you look around the Stasis Deck.","\n",{"->":"main_desc"},{"#f":1}],"main_desc":[["ev",{"VAR?":"ending_reached"},"!","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n",{"->":"main"},{"->":".^.^.^.1"},null]}],"nop","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"main":["ev",{"VAR?":"monster_distance"},1,"-",{"VAR=":"monster_distance","re":true},"/ev","ev",{"^->":"main"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"storylets"},"done",{"#f":3}],"storylets":[{"temp=":"ret"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"view_inventory"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"stasis_deck_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"nav_deck_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"crew_quarters_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"engine_room_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"damaged_bulkhead_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"alien_lab_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"medbay_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"life_support_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"bridge_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"ending_1_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"ending_2_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"ending_3_desc"},"ev",{"VAR?":"ret"},"/ev","thread",{"->":"ending_4_desc"},"done",{"#f":1}],"get_sanity":[["ev",{"VAR?":"monster_distance"},10,">","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","ev",{"VAR?":"high"},"/ev","~ret",{"->":".^.^.^.2"},null]}],[{"->":".^.b"},{"b":["\n","ev",{"VAR?":"low"},"/ev","~ret",{"->":".^.^.^.2"},null]}],"nop","\n",{"#f":1}],"view_inventory":[{"temp=":"ret"},["ev","str","^View your inventory","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n","^You have ","ev",{"VAR?":"unique_items"},"str","^no tools","/str",{"f()":"list_with_commas"},"out","/ev","^.","\n",["ev",{"VAR?":"num_wires"},1,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^You have a wire.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.14"},null]}],["ev",{"VAR?":"num_wires"},1,">","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^You have ","ev",{"VAR?":"num_wires"},"out","/ev","^ wires.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.14"},null]}],"nop","\n",["ev",{"VAR?":"num_fuses"},1,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^You have a fuse.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.18"},null]}],["ev",{"VAR?":"num_fuses"},1,">","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^You have ","ev",{"VAR?":"num_fuses"},"out","/ev","^ fuses.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.18"},null]}],"nop","\n",["ev",{"VAR?":"num_screws"},1,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^You have a screw.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.22"},null]}],["ev",{"VAR?":"num_screws"},1,">","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","^You have ","ev",{"VAR?":"num_screws"},"out","/ev","^ screws.","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.22"},null]}],"nop","\n",{"->":"ret","var":true},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"list_with_commas":[{"temp=":"if_empty"},{"temp=":"list"},"ev",{"VAR?":"list"},"LIST_COUNT","/ev",["du","ev",2,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["pop","\n","ev",{"VAR?":"list"},"LIST_MIN","out","/ev","^ and ","ev",{"VAR?":"list"},{"VAR?":"list"},"LIST_MIN","-",{"VAR?":"if_empty"},{"f()":".^.^.^"},"out","/ev","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.10"},null]}],["du","ev",1,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["pop","\n","ev",{"VAR?":"list"},"out","/ev","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.10"},null]}],["du","ev",0,"==","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["pop","\n","ev",{"VAR?":"if_empty"},"out","/ev","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.10"},null]}],[{"->":".^.b"},{"b":["pop","\n","ev",{"VAR?":"list"},"LIST_MIN","out","/ev","^, ","ev",{"VAR?":"list"},{"VAR?":"list"},"LIST_MIN","-",{"VAR?":"if_empty"},{"f()":".^.^.^"},"out","/ev","\n",{"->":".^.^.^.10"},null]}],"nop","\n",{"#f":1}],"nav_deck_desc":[{"temp=":"ret"},["ev",{"VAR?":"player_location"},{"VAR?":"stasis_deck"},"==",{"VAR?":"player_location"},{"VAR?":"engine_room"},"==","||","/ev",{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n","ev","str","^Enter navigation deck","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},{"->":".^.^.^.2"},{"c-0":["\n","ev",{"VAR?":"nav_deck"},"/ev",{"VAR=":"player_location","re":true},{"->t->":"nav_deck_body"},{"->":"ret","var":true},{"#f":5}]}]}],"nop","\n","done",{"#f":1}],"nav_deck_body":[["^The grand view to the outside is blocked by metal shutters.
